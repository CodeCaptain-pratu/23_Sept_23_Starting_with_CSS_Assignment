QUESTION:Build an HTML page with multiple paragraphs, each assigned a unique class name. Write CSS rules using
class selectors to apply distinct styling to each paragraph. Follow the BEM naming convention and
explain how you've named the classes=
Answer:BEM stands for (Block Element Modifier)
1) Block :The main component.
2) Element :Represent the part of Block.
3) Modifier :Represent a variation or modification of the element's
style or behavior


Benifits of using BEM:
1) Consistency: The naming convention is predictable and easy to 
understand
2) Modularity:Styles are scoped to specific blocks and elements, 
reducing the risk of conflicts.
3) Scalability: It's easy to extend and maintain styles for large
projects.
