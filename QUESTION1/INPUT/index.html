     2) Internal css
     3) External css
     -->
    <!-- In above example we have three div with same id, we have 
     given "color:black" and "backgrounde-color:aqua" using external 
     css but we are not able to see it in the output because of 
     external css is overriden by internal css which we have 
     given in the style tag which is our Internal css where we have 
     given the "color:blue" and "background-color:pink" and we can see 
     it in the output for the 2nd and 3rd div now if we do not use 
     the Inline css for the 1st div then the first div also look like 
     the 2nd and 3rd div, It will also take the properties given by 
     Internal css, But Inline css has the higher precedence that is
     why when we give Inline css to the first div It is applicable 
     to only first div and It overrides the Both Internal and External 
     css as well.-->
